# Intro-to-AI-final-project

to run on student machines first type this command:
	python3 -m pip install poke-battle-sim

11/2:
	- made git hub repo
	- figured out how the basic interface btwn the AI agent I'm making and the pokemon battle sim will work
	- made a simple demo of the logic for a specific pokemon match up
	- ==============
	- need to work on generalizing for an unspecified pokemon
	- need to make helper functions that pick moves, get/calc stats and damage

11/4:
	- put data files in drive
	- began implementing damage calc function (still have bugs to iron out)

11/5:
	- finished implementing damage calc (bugs have been ironed out, still have edge cases though)
	- pseudocoded out the logic for action selection and move selection
	- began generalizing functionality

11/6:
	- made the first 2 gym leader trainers
	- further generalized the battle demo, less values are hard coded now
	- advanced the AI to pick the move that will do the most damage to opposing pokemon

11/8:
	- finished damage calc edge cases

11/13:
	- split up the test.py script into separate files and in doing so fully generalized the project up to this point
